Nonna won't let you run her bot without your `DISCORD_TOKEN` set.

She passes down her discord bot token guide kept secret for 3 generations to
you [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).

Nonna says to run `yarn install` for all the ~~ingredients~~ dependencies to install. Don't @ her with your npm
garbagio.

Finally, it is very important to `yarn start` at just the right temperature to "shape of Italy" the Nonna bot.
