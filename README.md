Nonna won't let you run her bot without your `DISCORD_TOKEN` set.

She passes down her discord bot token guide kept secret for 3 generations to
you [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).

Nonna says to run `yarn install` for all the ~~ingredients~~ dependencies to install. Don't @ her with your npm
garbagio.

Finally, it is very important to `yarn start` at just the right temperature to "shape of Italy" the Nonna bot.

Permissions needed are:

bot
Send Messages
Send Messages in Threads (Not in use but might be)
Embed Links
Read Message History
Add Reactions
Use Slash Commands (For the future)

You also need to turn on the following in the Bot section of the Discord developers applications:

Server Members Intent
Message Content Intent
